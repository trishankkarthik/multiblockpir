3/14/2007      (EM) I fixed a bug discovered by Sameul J. Parsons.
                    The Conway Polynomials in ffield.py were being
                    reversed. They were still irreducible so the
                    resulting fields still worked but were not
                    technically fields generated by Conway Polynomials.
                    The bug is now fixed.

10/28/2003     (EM) I modified ffield.py to allow very large fields
                    (e.g., GF(2^32) and larger).  Also, I changed
                    file_ecc.py to allow for file names with spaces. 

7/3/2003       (EM) In genericmatrix.py I added the Solve function 
                    to solve possibly overdetermined sets of linear 
                    equations.  I also fixed bugs (e.g. in LUP).

5/20/2003      (EM) Added some speed optimizations.

11/19/2002     (EM) Initial release.
